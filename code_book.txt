File includes column names with variable descriptions contained within data frame spec_sub_act_feat_all:

'subjects' - a column of numbers from 1 to 30 indicating which subject the data was from

'activitys' - a column of factor variables. There were 6 activities tested. These included:
	- WALKING
	- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	- SITTING
	- STANDING
	- LAYING

Old column names were derived from a mixture of short terms: t = time measurement , f = Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) , Body = body measurement , Gravity for gravity measurement , Acc = Accelerometer signal , Gyro = gyroscope signal , Jerk = body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time , and Mag = magnitude calculated using the Euclidean norm. For more information on how each column was calculated see below. Each value was normalized to be between (-1,1) and measured in radians per second. The following columns were transformed into more descriptive headings:

'body accelerometer signal...[XYZ]' transformed from 'tBodyAcc-[XYZ]'

'gravity acclerometer signal...[XYZ]' transformed from 'tGravityAcc-[XYZ]'

'jerk body accelerometer signal...[XYZ]' transformed from 'tBodyAccJerk-[XYZ]'

'body gyroscope signal...[XYZ]' transformed from 'tBodyGyro-[XYZ]'

'body jerk gyroscope signal...[XYZ]' transformed from 'tBodyGyroJerk-[XYZ]'

'Magnitude of body accelerometer signal' transformed from 'tBodyAccMag'

'Magnitude of gravity accelerometer signal' transformed from 'tGravityAccMag'

'Magnitude of body jerk acceleromater signal' transformed from 'tBodyAccJerkMag'

'Magnitude of body gyroscope signal' transformed from 'tBodyGyroMag'

'Magnitude of body jerk gyroscope signal' transformed from 'tBodyGyroJerkMag'

'FFT applied to body accelerometer signal...[XYZ]' transformed from 'fBodyAcc-[XYZ]'

'FFT applied to body jerk accelerometer signal...[XYZ]' transformed from 'fBodyAccJerk-[XYZ]'

'FFT applied to body gyroscope signal...[XYZ]' transformed from 'fBodyGyro-[XYZ]'

'Magnitude of FFT applied to body accelerometer signal' transformed from 'fBodyAccMag'

'Magnitude of FFT applied to body jerk accelerometer signal' transformed from 'fBodyBodyAccJerkMag'

'Magnitude of FFT applied to body gyroscope signal' transformed from 'fBodyBodyGyroMag'

'Magnitude of FFT applied to body jerk gyroscope signal' transformed from 'fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag'

The last columns are the vectors between the two variables

'Vector of mean body accelerometer signal and gravity' transformed from 'angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)'         

'Vector of mean body jerk accelerometer signal and gravity' transformed from 'angle(tBodyAccJerkMean),gravityMean)' 

'Vector of mean body gyroscope signal and gravity' transformed from 'angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean)'    

'Vector of mean body jerk gyroscope signal and gravity' transformed from 'angle(tBodyGyroJerkMean,gravityMean)'

'Vector of gravity mean in [XYZ] direction' transformed from 'angle([XYZ],gravityMean)'

The ... means that the column had either a mean or standard deviation (std) variable. [XYZ] indicates in what direction of the XYZ plane the vector was going.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals (in original data set) are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
